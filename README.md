## Setup

To compile this package, it is recommended to create a separate build
directory:
```sh
mkdir _build && cd _build
cmake [OPTIONS] ..
make install
```

Please note that CMake produces a `CMakeCache.txt` file which should
be deleted to reconfigure a package from scratch.

## Dependencies

The Graphical Interface software depends on several packages which
have to be available on your machine.

 - Libraries:
   - urdfdom (version >= 0.3.0)
   - openscenegraph (version >= 3.2.0)
 - System tools:
   - CMake (>=2.6)
   - pkg-config
   - usual compilation tools (GCC/G++, make, etc.)

## Install standalone urdfdom

In order to read urdf files (see http://wiki.ros.org/urdf for the description), one has to install the urdfdom package which can come either along ROS library or be installed as a standalone library. Next section describes the second procedure.

urdfdom depends on both [console_bridge] and [urdfdom_headers]. The installation of both dependencies can be done with the following command lines in a terminal :
```sh
git clone git://github.com/ros/console_bridge.git && cd console_bridge
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

git clone git://github.com/ros/urdfdom_headers && cd urdfdom_headers
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

Finally, you just need to run the following command line to install [urdfdom] library :
```sh
git clone git://github.com/ros/urdfdom && cd urdfdom
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
